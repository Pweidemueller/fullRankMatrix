Description: This package will help users to create a full rank matrix out of their design matrix. It removes columns with only 0's, merged duplicated columns and discovers linearly dependent columns and then replaces linearly dependent columns with linearly independent columns that span the space of the original columns. This results in a full rank matrix that can be used as a design matrix in linear models.
