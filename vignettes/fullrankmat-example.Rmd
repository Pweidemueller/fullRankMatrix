We developed `fullRankMatrix` primarily for one-hot encoded design matrices used in linear models. In our case, we were faced with a 1-hot encoded design matrix, that had a lot of linearly dependent columns. This happened when modelling a lot of interaction terms. Since fitting a linear model on a design matrix with linearly dependent columns will produce results that can lead to misleading interpretation (s. example below), we decided to develop a package that will help with identifying linearly dependent columns and replacing them with columns constructed of orthogonal vectors that span the space of the previously linearly dependent columns.

The goal of `fullRankMatrix` is to remove empty columns (contain only 0's), merge duplicated columns (containing the same entries) and merge linearly dependent columns. These operations will create a matrix of full rank. The changes made to the columns are reflected in the column headers such that the columns can still be interpreted if the matrix is used in e.g. a linear model fit.

## Installation

You can install `fullRankMatrix` directly from CRAN. Just paste the following snippet into your R console:

```r
install.packages("fullRankMatrix")
```


You can install the development version of `fullRankMatrix` from [GitHub](https://github.com/Pweidemueller/fullRankMatrix) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Pweidemueller/fullRankMatrix")
```

## Citation

If you want to cite this package in a publication, you can run the following
command in your R console:

## Linearly dependent columns span a space of a certain dimension
In order to visualize it, let's look at a very simple example in 3D space. Say we have a matrix with three columns. The first column lies in the first and third dimension. The second and third column lie in the first and second dimension. Since this is a very simple example, we immediately spot that the third column is a multiple if the second column. If we draw the columns as vectors they lie perfectly on top of each other. This means instead of the two columns spanning a 2D space they just occupy a line, i.e. a 1D space. This is identified by `fullRankMatrix`, it replaces these two linearly dependent columns with one vector that captures the 1D space in which column 2 and column 2 used to lie. 


```{r setup}
library(fullRankMatrix)
```

```{r}
c1 <- c(1, 0, 1)
c2 <- c(1, 2, 0)
c3 <- c(2, 4, 0)

mat <- cbind(c1, c2, c3)

make_full_rank_matrix(mat)
```
```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Visualisation of identifying and replacing linearly dependent columns."}

```


## Worked through example

Above was a rather abstract example that was easy to visualize, let's now walk through the utilities of `fullRankMatrix` when applied to a more realistic design matrix.

When using linear models you should check if any of the columns in your design matrix are linearly dependent. If there are, this will alter the interpretation of the fit. Here is a rather constructed example where we are interested in identifying the factors that make fruit sweet. We can classify fruit into what fruit type they are and also at what season they were harvested in. 
```{r}
# let's say we have 10 fruits and can classify them into strawberries, apples or pears
# in addition we classify them by the season they were harvested in
strawberry <- c(1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0)
apple <- c(0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0)
pear <- c(0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1)
spring <- c(1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
summer <- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0)
fall <- c(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1)

# let's pretend we know how each factor influences the sweetness of a fruit
# in this case we say that strawberry and summer have the biggest influence on sweetness
strawberry_sweet <- strawberry * rnorm(10, 4)
apple_sweet <- apple * rnorm(10, 1)
pear_sweet <- pear * rnorm(10, 0.5)
spring_sweet <- spring * rnorm(10, 2)
summer_sweet <- summer * rnorm(10, 5)
fall_sweet <- fall * rnorm(10, 1)

sweetness <- strawberry_sweet + apple_sweet + pear_sweet +
  spring_sweet + summer_sweet + fall_sweet

mat <- as.matrix(data.frame(strawberry,apple,pear,spring,summer,fall))

fit <- lm(sweetness ~ mat + 0)
print(summary(fit))
```
As you can see `lm` realizes that there are linearly dependent columns (`matsummer` is not defined) but it doesn't indicate what columns it is linearly dependent with.

So if you would just look at the columns and not consider the `NA` further, you would interpret that `strawberry` and `apple` make fruit sweet.

However, when you look at the model matrix you can see that the `summer` column is a linear combination of the `strawberry` and `apple` columns (or vice versa). So truly any of the three factors could contribute to the sweetness of a fruit, the linear model has no way of recovering which one given these 10 examples. 
```{r}
mat
```
To make such cases more obvious and retain interpretability of the linear model fit we wrote `fullRankMatrix`, it removes linearly dependent columns and renames the remaining columns to make the dependencies clear using the `make_full_rank_matrix()` function.

```{r}
library(fullRankMatrix)
result <- make_full_rank_matrix(mat)
mat_fr <- result$matrix
space_list <- result$space_list
mat_fr
```

```{r}
fit <- lm(sweetness ~ mat_fr + 0)
print(summary(fit))
```
You can see that there are no more undefined columns. The columns `strawberry`, `apple` and `summer` were removed and replaced with two columns (`SPACE_1_AXIS1`, `SPACE_1_AXIS2`) that are linearly independent (orthogonal) vectors that span the space previously spanned by the linearly dependent columns `strawberry`, `apple` and `summer`. The original columns that are contained with a space can be viewed in the returned `space_list`:
```{r}
space_list
```

In terms of interpretation the individual axes of the space have no meaning, but seeing that the space of `strawberry`, `apple` and `summer` show a significant association with the sweetness of fruit. A further resolution which of the three terms is most strongly associated with `sweetness` is not possible with the given number of observations, but there is definitely an association of `sweetness` with the space spanned by the three terms.
